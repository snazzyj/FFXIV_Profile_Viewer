Api-Hack capstone. 

Created this app for Final Fantasy 14 players to view their own characters or other player characters. Upon viewing a profile, they can see the current gear equipped to the active class that is being played. In addition, they can also see their progression in the game when it comes to collecting minions and mounts. It also allows to them to see how many quests they have completed.
